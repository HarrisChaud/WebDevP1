      <p class="p1">Snowboard boots are considerably more comfortable than most ski boots. Riders will often look at skiers in their hard plastic boots and wonder why they bother â€“ they are hard to get on and off, a pain to walk in, and for some people with badly fitted boots, a pain to ski in, too. Although snowboard boots are stiff and people are surely happy to get them off at the end of the day, they are much friendly on the feet.</p>
