      <p class="p1">Snowboard boots are considerably more comfortable than most ski boots. Riders will often look at skiers in their hard plastic boots and wonder why they bother – they are hard to get on and off, a pain to walk in, and for some people with badly fitted boots, a pain to ski in, too. Although snowboard boots are stiff and people are surely happy to get them off at the end of the day, they are much friendly on the feet.</p>

      <ul class="side-text">
        <li>Are you still not sure that snowboarding is for you?</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="p1">If I'm going with a slower group, or wanting to hit every lump and bump on the piste, then it's the snowboard every time. You can spend twice as long on a piste, finding every jump, and that free and creative feeling of snowboarding is unrivalled when exploring all the varied terrain.</p>

      <ul class="side-text">
        <li>Okay I understand you just need a little more reasoning</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="p1">“Snowboards are not just pieces of wood, steel, and fiberglass. They are tools of escape. A medium for personal expression. A way to challenge fears, push limits, and share incredible experiences with your friends.” Shred Stuff There are a lot of reasons why I think snowboarding is one of the best ways to spend a winter vacation, but, since you probably don’t want me to ramble on like Shakespeare about powder.</p>
